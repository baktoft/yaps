# YAPS - (Yet Another Positioning Solver) <img src="man/figures/yaps_logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="100" />
YAPS is an open source alternative to estimate tracks of aquatic animals tagged with acoustic transmitters. The original version of YAPS was presented in Baktoft, Gjelland, Ã˜kland & Thygesen (2017): [Positioning of aquatic animals based on time-of-arrival and random walk models using YAPS (Yet Another Positioning Solver)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14278-z.pdf). Since then, we have worked on improving the code, adding more features and adding examples and tutorials to help users implementing YAPS in their studies.  

Have a look at the step-by-step guides found under [Articles](https://baktoft.github.io/yaps/articles/) for a quick intro to hands-on working with YAPS.
