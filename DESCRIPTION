Description: Estimate tracks of animals tagged with acoustic transmitters. 'yaps' was introduced in 2017 as a transparent open-source tool to estimate positions of fish (and other aquatic animals) tagged with acoustic transmitters. Based on registrations of acoustic transmitters on hydrophones positioned in a fixed array, 'yaps' enables users to synchronize the collected data (i.e. correcting for drift in the internal clocks of the hydrophones/receivers) and subsequently to estimate tracks of the tagged animals. The paper introducing 'yaps' is available in open access at Baktoft, Gjelland, Økland & Thygesen (2017) <doi:10.1038/s41598-017-14278-z>. Also check out our cookbook with a completely worked through example at Baktoft, Gjelland, Økland, Rehage, Rodemann, Corujo, Viadero & Thygesen (2019) <DOI:10.1101/2019.12.16.877688>. Additional tutorials will eventually make their way onto the project website at <https://baktoft.github.io/yaps/>.
