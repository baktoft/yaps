Description: Estimate tracks of animals tagged with acoustic transmitters. R package 'yaps' was introduced in 2017 as a transparent open-source tool to estimate positions of fish (and other aquatic animals) tagged with acoustic transmitters. Based on detections of acoustic transmitters on a fixed array of hydrophones, 'yaps' facilitates users to both synchronize the internal clocks of the hydrophones/receivers and subsequently to estimate tracks of the tagged animals. The paper introducing 'yaps' is available in open access at  <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14278-z> as is a cookbook with a completely worked through example at <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.877688v1>.
